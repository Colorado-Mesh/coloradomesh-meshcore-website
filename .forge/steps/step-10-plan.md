# Step 10 Execution Plan: Final integration validation

## Goal
Validate the redesigned Colorado MeshCore site across automated checks, browser runtime behavior, Docker runtime behavior, route removals, and stale-reference guards before final review.

## Current Code Observations
- The working tree was clean before starting Step 10.
- Steps 1-9 are committed, with Step 9 adding `.github/workflows/docker-release.yml` and a no-push Docker smoke job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` includes current core routes plus `/tools` subroutes and does not include `/observer`.
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` and `src/components/Footer.tsx` link to current Home, Map, Tools, Guides, Blog, About, and Discord destinations with no `/observer` links.
- `src/components/index.ts` no longer exports observer/health components; it exports the current brand, map, stats, and tool components.
- `package.json` targets Node `>=24 <26` and has `lint`, `typecheck`, and `build` scripts.
- `Dockerfile` uses Node 24 standalone output and runs as non-root `nextjs`.
- `compose.yaml` serves the app on port 3000 and healthchecks `/api/map/stats`.
- The stale-reference grep currently reports two comment-only references: `src/lib/utils.ts` and `src/lib/data/landmarks.ts`.

## Files to Change
- `.forge/steps/step-10-plan.md` — record Step 10 execution and any discovered fixes before editing.
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — remove stale Denver MeshCore wording from a file header comment.
- `src/lib/data/landmarks.ts` — update the stale naming-standard comment to Colorado MeshCore.
- `src/lib/map/store.ts` — replace the configured-MQTT placeholder with a lazy MQTT-backed snapshot adapter that caches normalized node data from configured broker/topic messages.
- `src/app/api/map/nodes/route.ts` — force Node.js dynamic runtime for MQTT-backed runtime configuration.
- `src/app/api/map/stats/route.ts` — force Node.js dynamic runtime for MQTT-backed runtime configuration.
- `.github/workflows/docker-release.yml` — correct the OCI image license label so the release image metadata does not claim MIT for GPL-derived map work.
- `LICENSE` — replace stale MIT/Denver metadata with GPL-3.0-or-later repository licensing.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — align contribution licensing guidance with the repository license.
- `compose.yaml` — stop forcing sample map data in Docker when MQTT is configured.
- `.env.example` — document blank sample-data default and explicit demo-mode behavior.

## Ordered Implementation Checklist
1. Write this focused Step 10 execution plan from the master plan and current code observations.
2. Apply the known stale-comment cleanup in `src/lib/utils.ts` and `src/lib/data/landmarks.ts`.
3. Run automated verification: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `docker build -t colorado-meshcore-site:final .`, and `docker compose config`.
4. Run stale-reference guards for old branding, old observer links, old public metrics APIs, and prototype/mock artifacts.
5. Start the dev server and browser-validate the homepage, `/map`, `/tools`, tool subroutes, `/guides`, a guide page, `/blog`, a blog post, `/about`, mobile navigation, and intentional `/observer` 404 behavior.
6. Start the Docker runtime and repeat golden-path browser/API validation against the container-served app.
7. Inspect browser console and network output for hydration errors, missing assets, blocked CSP, failed map/API requests, or unexpected legacy endpoint calls.
8. Fix only integration defects discovered by validation, updating this plan before any additional file edits.
9. Address final review FIX-1 by implementing lazy MQTT ingestion in `src/lib/map/store.ts`: connect only when MQTT is configured and sample data is off, subscribe to the configured topic, normalize JSON payloads into `MapNode` records, cache latest nodes in memory, merge incremental per-node messages without discarding unrelated cached nodes, and report connection/message state through `MapSnapshot.connection` and `MapStats.connectionState`.
10. Address final review FIX-2 by replacing the release workflow OCI license label with a GPL-compatible SPDX expression for the distributed image.
11. Address focused re-review feedback by including the MQTT password in the config key so credential changes recreate the client.
12. Address final full-review blockers by aligning root/contribution licensing with GPL-3.0-or-later and removing Docker sample-data overrides that mask configured MQTT.
13. Re-run automated checks and targeted MQTT-config smoke checks.
14. Stage Step 10 files, request Forge re-review/final review, save updated review artifacts, and commit if approved.

## Interfaces and Data Contracts
- Supported public live-data endpoints remain `GET /api/map/nodes` and `GET /api/map/stats`.
- Removed legacy observer and metric routes should intentionally 404 with no redirects.
- Docker runtime must serve the Next standalone app on port 3000 without requiring local `.env` secrets.
- Browser map and stats flows must use `/api/map/*`, not `/api/stats`, `/api/health`, or `/api/nodes`.

## Verification Plan
- Automated: `npm run lint`
- Automated: `npm run typecheck`
- Automated: `npm run build`
- Docker: `docker build -t colorado-meshcore-site:final .`
- Docker: `docker compose config`
- API/route: curl `/`, `/api/map/stats`, `/api/map/nodes`, and `/observer` in dev and Docker runtimes.
- Regression: `grep -R "Denver MeshCore\|denvermc.com\|/observer\|/api/stats\|/api/health\|/api/nodes" -n src content public .github Dockerfile compose.yaml package.json || true`
- Manual/browser: homepage, `/map`, `/tools`, `/tools/repeater-name`, `/tools/companion-name`, `/tools/prefix-matrix`, `/tools/serial-usb`, `/guides`, `/guides/getting-started`, `/blog`, a blog post, `/about`, responsive navigation, console, and network.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop and ask the user before adding new product features beyond fixing validation defects.
- Stop before pushing tags, publishing releases, or pushing Docker images.
- Stop before adding compatibility redirects for removed routes, because hard removal was an explicit project decision.
- Stop if Docker or browser validation fails due to missing local platform capabilities rather than an app defect, and report the unvalidated area explicitly.
